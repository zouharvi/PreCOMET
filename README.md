The PreCOMET is a fork of [Unbabel/COMET](https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET/) from version 2.2.4.
All original licensing applies.

It is used in the [subset2evaluate](https://github.com/zouharvi/subset2evaluate) package.
The divergent fork was created such that this package does not conflict with the original one.
